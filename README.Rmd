## Shiny app to label time series data

Labeling time series data is a typical preprocessing step for developing time series forecasting, classification or anomaly detection models. This Shiny app allows you to label very large quantities of time series data interactively, yet quickly.

[GitHub](https://github.com/rsangole/tslabeler).
