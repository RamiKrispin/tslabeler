## Shiny app to label time series data

Labeling time series data is a typical preprocessing step for developing
time series forecasting, classification or anomaly detection models.
This Shiny app allows you to label very large quantities of time series
data interactively, yet quickly.

[GitHub](https://github.com/rsangole/tslabeler).
